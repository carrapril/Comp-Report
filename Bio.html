    <h3>HERE'S TO THE FUTURE!!!</h3>

    <p class="green-bg text">I have a little experience with front end development.  However, I am a little rusty after taking a break from coding.  I tried to pursue <del>Cyber Security and AWS</del>; however, I found out designing websites/applications was my passion.  I started this program in hopes of becoming a successful Full Stack Developer.  I have a creative mind, enjoy working with people, and love computers.  By combining all of those skills, what better career is Software Development.  I look forward to working with <b>San Diego Global University</b> and classmates in the future. </p>
